# Speech-to-text-web-app
This Flask web application allows users to upload audio files in various formats (e.g., MP3, WAV, FLAC) for automatic speech-to-text transcription. Once uploaded, the app transcribes the audio content using the AssemblyAI API, and then provides the transcribed text as a downloadable text file.
